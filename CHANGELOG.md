## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-02-28

### Security

- Replaced the 32-bit Bernstein-style integer fold in `AuditLogger.computeHash`
  with SHA-256 via Node.js `crypto.createHash`. The hash chain now produces
  64-character hex digests, making the tamper-evidence mechanism suitable for
  both development and production deployments.

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-02-26

### Added

- `TrustGate` — main middleware class composing trust checking, budget
  enforcement, and audit logging into a single `evaluate()` call
- `TrustChecker` — static `>=` trust level comparison with manual `setLevel()`
  and per-tool `setRequirement()` APIs
- `BudgetTracker` — hard-cap per-period spending limits with lazy period reset;
  supports `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, and `monthly` windows
- `AuditLogger` — append-only hash chain audit log with `verifyChain()` and
  `exportJSON()` APIs
- `createConfig()` — Zod-validated configuration factory with safe defaults
- `TrustGateConfigSchema` — exported Zod schema for external validation
- Full TypeScript type exports: `TrustGateConfig`, `BudgetConfig`,
  `GateDecision`, `AuditEntry`, `SpendingResult`, `BudgetSummary`
- Examples: `basic-usage.ts`, `with-budget.ts`, `custom-checker.ts`
- Apache 2.0 license
- `FIRE_LINE.md` documenting the patent gate boundary (P0-01 ATP)

### Notes

- This is a scaffold release. Core adaptive governance features are reserved
  under patent application P0-01 and will not appear in this package until
  after filing and clearance.
